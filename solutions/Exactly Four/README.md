# CEMC Problem of the Week
# [Problem E. Exactly Four](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/documents/2024/POTWE-24-N-01-P.pdf)

A machine dispenses four kinds of tokens. Red tokens are worth 25 points, blue
tokens are worth 10 points, green tokens are worth 5 points, and yellow tokens
are worth 1 point. The machine never runs out of tokens to dispense.
To get tokens from the machine, people enter a total number of points, and the
machine will dispense the fewest number of tokens that total that number of
points. For example, if someone enters 30 points, the machine will dispense 1 red
token and 1 green token, because their total value is 25 + 5 = 30 points, and this
total cannot be obtained using fewer tokens.
For how many different total numbers of points will the machine dispense exactly
4 tokens?
